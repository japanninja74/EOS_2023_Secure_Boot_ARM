# OSES_project
This material was originally developed as part of an assignment of the _Operating Systems for Embedded Systems_ course delivered at _Politecnico di Torino_ by Prof. Stefano Di Carlo.

We implemented a lightweight secure boot process which is based on performance counters.

On the 'empty_project' branch you can find a startup project for the lab experience, while the 'development' branch includes a proposed solution by us.
